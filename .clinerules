## Design Philosophy - MUST FOLLOW

### ✓ DO Follow These Principles

1. **Simplicity First**
   - Clean markdown > Complex HTML
   - Simple CSS > Fancy components
   - Readable > Flashy

2. **Bold Elements for Emphasis**
   - All dates must be bold: `**October 2024 — Present**`
   - Job titles and project names must be bold
   - Dates styled in blue color via CSS

3. **Consistent Formatting**
   - Same date format throughout: `**Month Year — Month Year**` or `**Year**`
   - Employment: Position | Company, then date on next line
   - Projects: Title | Company | Date
   - Community: Title | Organization | Date

4. **Typography Hierarchy**
   - H2: Section headers (Employment, Projects, etc.)
   - H3: Subsection headers (job titles, project categories)
   - H4: If needed for sub-items
   - Bold: Dates, names, important info
   - Italic: Technology lists, metadata

5. **Spacing Consistency**
   - 3rem between major sections
   - 2.5rem for subsections
   - 1.5rem for items
   - Use `---` for section dividers (styled as gradient lines)

### ✗ DO NOT Do These Things

1. **NEVER Add Complex HTML Components**
   - No `<div>` soup with custom classes
   - No timeline HTML structures
   - No card grids with complex markup
   - Keep it markdown!

2. **NEVER Break Markdown Rendering**
   - Jekyll needs clean markdown to render properly
   - HTML can break list rendering, spacing, etc.
   - Test locally before pushing

3. **NEVER Add Heavy JavaScript**
   - Site is static and fast
   - No frameworks (React, Vue, etc.)
   - No complex interactions

4. **NEVER Change Core Design Without Permission**
   - User loves current look
   - Ask before major visual changes
   - Make incremental improvements only

5. **NEVER Skip Date Verification**
   - Always check dates against resume: `/Users/zak/prof/docs/resume_zsb_latest.pdf`
   - Dates must be accurate
   - Ask user if uncertain

## File Structure & Purpose

### Critical Files (DO modify for content updates)

**`_pages/about.md`** - THE ENTIRE SITE
- Single source of truth for all content
- Pure markdown with consistent formatting
- Sections: About, Employment, Projects, Community, Education, Skills
- Uses anchor links: `## <a name="employment"></a>Employment History`

**`_data/navigation.yml`** - Top Navigation Bar
- Anchor links to sections on homepage
- Format: `url: /#section-name`
- Don't add pages, just section links

**`_config.yml`** - Site Configuration
- Author info (name, bio, avatar, location, employer)
- Site title and description
- Keep profile info updated

**`images/headshot.jpeg`** - Profile Photo
- Current photo is formatted for circular display
- 175x175px circular crop via CSS

### Styling Files (modify carefully)

**`_sass/_variables.scss`** - Colors & Typography
```scss
$primary-color: #2563EB;      // Blue for dates, links, accents
$secondary-color: #7C3AED;     // Purple accent (rarely used)
$darker-gray: #1F2937;         // Main text color
$doc-font-size: 17;            // Base font size
```

**`_sass/_modern-portfolio.scss`** - Custom Styles (94 lines - keep it simple!)
- Section header styling (bold, blue underline)
- Date styling (bold, blue color)
- HR divider styling (gradient lines)
- Spacing and typography
- Smooth scroll behavior

**`assets/css/main.scss`** - Main Stylesheet
- Imports all SCSS files
- Includes `@import "modern-portfolio";`
- Don't modify unless adding new SCSS files

### Files to NEVER Modify

**`_sass/_sidebar.scss`** - Avatar styling is perfect, don't touch!
```scss
img {
  width: 175px;
  height: 175px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

**Theme files** (`_layouts/`, `_includes/`) - Academic Pages theme core
- Only modify if absolutely necessary
- Changes here can break the entire site

## Common Tasks & How To Do Them

### Adding a New Job

1. Open `_pages/about.md`
2. Find Employment History section
3. Add at the top (most recent first):

```markdown
### Job Title | Company Name
**Month Year — Present** (or end date)

* Responsibility bullet point
* Another responsibility
* Key achievement
```

4. If this is now current position, update previous "Present" to end date
5. Verify dates against resume
6. Commit with clear message

### Adding a New Project

1. Open `_pages/about.md`
2. Find Projects section
3. Choose category: "Impactful 0-1 ML/AI Projects" or "ML Modernization Efforts"
4. Add:

```markdown
**Project Name** | Company | **Year** (or **Year-Year**)

Description of project, what was built, impact, results.

_Technologies: Tool1, Tool2, Tool3, Tool4_
```

5. Keep projects in reverse chronological order

### Updating Skills

1. Open `_pages/about.md`
2. Find Technical Skills section
3. Update categories as needed:

```markdown
**Category Name:** Tool1, Tool2, Tool3, Tool4

**Category Name:** Tool5, Tool6, Tool7
```

4. Keep primary skills first in each category
5. Separate categories with blank line

### Adding Community Activity

```markdown
**Activity Name** | Organization | **Dates**

Description of activity, impact, role.
```

### Updating Profile Info

1. Open `_config.yml`
2. Update relevant fields:
   - `name`: Full name
   - `bio`: Short tagline (use | for separation)
   - `employer`: Current company
   - `avatar`: Filename in images/ folder

### Changing Colors

1. Open `_sass/_variables.scss`
2. Modify color variables:
   - `$primary-color`: Main accent (dates, underlines)
   - `$text-color`: Body text
   - `$darker-gray`: Headers

3. Test locally to ensure contrast is good

# If bundler issue:
gem install bundler:2.1.4

# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Run local server
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload

# Visit in browser
open http://localhost:4000
```

### Deployment

## Content Guidelines

### Date Formats to Use

**Employment dates:**
- Current: `**October 2024 — Present**`
- Past: `**December 2022 — September 2024**`
- Em dash (—) not hyphen (-)

**Project dates:**
- Single year: `**2024**`
- Range: `**2023-2024**`
- Hyphen (-) not em dash for year ranges

**Education dates:**
- `**January 2015**`
- `**May 2008**`

### Writing Style

- **Concise bullets** - Start with action verbs
- **Quantify impact** - "300+ attendees", "1500+ members", "9 person team"
- **Emphasize results** - What shipped, what improved, what changed
- **Technology lists** - Keep in italics at end of projects
- **Bold for emphasis** - Dates, numbers, project names, companies

### Section Order (DO NOT CHANGE)

1. About (intro paragraph)
2. Employment History
3. Projects
4. Community & Extracurricular
5. Education
6. Technical Skills

This order is intentional based on user preferences.

---

## Resume Sync

**Source of Truth:** `/Users/zak/prof/docs/resume_zsb_latest.pdf`

When user mentions updating from resume:
1. Read the PDF carefully
2. Extract dates EXACTLY as written
3. Ask clarifying questions if anything is ambiguous
4. Verify all dates before committing
5. Keep employment history in sync with resume
6. Match job titles exactly

---

Border:         #E5E7EB
```

## Troubleshooting

### Site Broken After Push?

1. Check GitHub Actions for build errors
2. Look for YAML frontmatter errors in about.md
3. Check for unclosed bold/italic markers
4. Revert last commit if needed: `git revert HEAD`

### Dates Not Showing in Blue?

1. Ensure dates are bold: `**Date**`
2. Check CSS is loaded: `_sass/_modern-portfolio.scss` imported
3. Check browser cache (hard refresh)

### Navigation Not Working?

1. Verify anchor links: `<a name="section"></a>` in about.md
2. Check navigation.yml has `url: /#section`
3. Ensure smooth scroll CSS is present

### Profile Photo Not Circular?

1. Check `_sass/_sidebar.scss` has:
   - `width: 175px`
   - `height: 175px`
   - `border-radius: 50%`
   - `object-fit: cover`
2. Clear browser cache

## What Made Current Design Successful

### Iteration History

1. **Phase 1:** Added content (good)
2. **Phase 2:** Made single-page (great decision)
3. **Phase 3:** Added section navigation (perfect)
4. **Phase 4:** Tried complex timeline/cards (BROKE - too complex)
5. **Phase 5:** Simplified to markdown (SUCCESS - current design)

### Why Phase 5 Works

- **Simple markdown** renders consistently
- **Bold dates in blue** stand out perfectly
- **Clean hierarchy** is easy to scan
- **No complex HTML** means no breaking
- **Fast to load** and maintain
- **Mobile-friendly** by default
- **User loves it!**

### Key Insight

**Less is more.** The simple, clean design with bold typography beats fancy components every time.
